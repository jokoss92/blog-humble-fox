      <p>His first notable work. Acts as prequel for the Solid series.</p>
      <p>The game revolves around Solid Snake, an operative of the special forces unit FOXHOUND, who goes on a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy "Metal Gear", a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world, as well as rescue a number of fellow agents who have been captured by the enemy. The game was a major international success, with the NES version selling 1 million units in the United States.</p>

      <p>His second notable work. Sequel to Metal Gear (1987)</p>
      <p>Set in 1999, a few years after the events of the original game, Solid Snake must infiltrate a heavily defended territory known as Zanzibar Land to rescue a kidnapped scientist and destroy the revised "Metal Gear D". The game significantly evolved the stealth-based game system of its predecessor "in almost every way", introduced a complex storyline dealing with themes such as the nature of warfare and nuclear proliferation, and is considered "one of the best 8 bit games ever made."</p>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid (1998)</h2>
      <img src="https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/metal-gear-solid-sale-playstation-store.jpg.optimal.jpg" width="60%" alt="Metal Gear Solid">
      <p>Metal Gear Solid is a game where the protagonist returns to deal with FOXHOUND. The game is famous for its unorthodox boss battle with Psycho Mantis, where the boss can read the inside of player's memory card (and made various comments of famous games if it knows about it) and able to dodge all your attacks unless the player unplugged the controller from first port and plugged it to the second port.</p>
      <p>The game follows Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND, a renegade special forces unit. Snake must liberate two hostages, the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer, confront the terrorists, and stop them from launching a nuclear strike.Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting was used throughout the entire game.</p>

      <h2>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001)</h2>
      <img src="https://www.androidguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shield-metal-gear-solid-2-screenshots-1.jpg" width="60%" alt="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001)">
      <p>The game is considered to be ahead of its time, dealing with themes that later became culturally relevant in the 2010s, drawing comparisons to concepts such as social media, news feeds, post-truth politics, fake news, alternative facts and echo chambers.</p>
      <p>The story revolves around the "Big Shell", a massive offshore clean-up facility seized by a group of terrorists who call themselves the "Sons of Liberty". They demand a massive ransom in exchange for the life of the President of the United States and threaten to destroy the facility and create a cataclysmic environmental disaster if their demands are not met. The motives and identities of many of the antagonists and allies change throughout the course of the game, as the protagonists discover a world-shaking conspiracy constructed by a powerful organization known as the Patriots.</p>
